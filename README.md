# is-exact-version

This module is a complete re-write of [bendrucker/exact-version](https://github.com/bendrucker/exact-version).
It drops support for end-of-life versions of node, is written in TypeScript, and uses Jest for testing.
Why another library? I needed something more complete (e.g. with support for "commitish" version range strings),
and I first attempted to [make a PR](https://github.com/bendrucker/exact-version/pull/1)
but then was met with belligerence.
Making my own implementation seemed the more civil course of action than engaging in an argument.
